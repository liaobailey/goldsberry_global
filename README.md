I created this repository to try to replicate some of the visualizations Kirk Goldsberry has. This project is one that maps shot selection amongst top NBA Players.

In this project, I wanted to implement my data analysis in a webapp and stumbled onto StreamLit. Picking up StreamLit syntax was not too difficult and I was able to deploy a webapp to the ip address below:

# Getting Started

I played around with the NBA Api end point and was able to successfully make api calls. However, once I integrated with AWS, the endpoint stopped working, which seems to be something that the NBA actively blocks. I ended up downloading the data to my remote computer and uploading it onto AWS as a static CSV.

From there I added filters for top players, makes/misses, crunch time, and wins/losses. I then plotted the location of each shot onto a shot map.

Here are some of my favorite conclusions:
